# Dice
Sample application showcasing Gradle composite builds and Integration testing.

## Gradle composite builds.
This project uses Gradle composite build, so the application can be built using subprojects instead of a monolithic. Using subprojects can be very efficient in large teams allowing them to develop independently.

## Composed Library
The presentation layer uses [Composed](https://github.com/karthyks/Composed) library to show Overlay. Please refer the library for its usage and advantages.

## Project Architecture
- Clean architecture.
- MVVM design pattern in presentation layer.
- Integration testing.
- Hilt Dagger Dependency injection.
- Instrumentation testing.
